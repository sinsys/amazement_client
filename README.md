# aMAZEment - A maze runner game

## Description
aMAZEment is a maze runner style game where you have to navigate through a randomly generated maze as quickly as possible. Your run will be timed and a leaderboard will display the best runners out there!

There is one catch... you cannot see the entire maze! You will be limited to a reduced viewport of the maze and must traverse it to win. But don't worry; any tiles you have already stepped on will be marked so that you don't repeat yourself.

## Features
 - 3 levels of difficulty
 - Near infinite possible maze combinations
 - Keyboard or touch navigation
